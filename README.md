# Front-End Case Project

This repository contains a **Front-End Case Project** developed as part of a technical assessment. The project showcases a dynamic and responsive web application built with modern tools and technologies.

## Features

- **Dynamic Product Listing**: Fetches products dynamically from the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/).  
- **Category-Based Filtering**: Displays products based on their categories.
- **Product Details Page**: Shows detailed information about individual products.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Efficient State Management**: Leveraging React's `useState` and `useEffect` for seamless UI updates.
- **Reusable Components**: Built with a modular approach for scalability and maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **React**: For building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety throughout the codebase.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Radix UI**: For accessible and customizable components.
- **Swiper.js**: Image gallery slider.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MuharremGonel/front-case.git
   cd front-case
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Integration

The project uses the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/) for fetching product data. Example endpoints:
- All Products: `https://dummyjson.com/products`
- By Category: `https://dummyjson.com/products/category/{category}`
